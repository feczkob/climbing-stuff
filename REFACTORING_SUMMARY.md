# Refactoring Summary for GitHub Issue #2

## Overview
This refactoring addresses [GitHub Issue #2](https://github.com/feczkob/climbing-stuff/issues/2) by implementing a new architecture where scrapers are configured with category-specific URLs upon instantiation, rather than receiving URLs as arguments during discount extraction.

## Key Changes

### 1. New `DiscountUrl` Class
**File:** `scrapers/discount_dto.py`

- Added a new `@dataclass` called `DiscountUrl` with fields:
  - `site`: The scraper site name (e.g., "bergfreunde")
  - `category`: The product category (e.g., "friends-nuts")
  - `url`: The URL to scrape for that site/category combination
- Updated `Discount` class to include an optional `category` field
- Added proper type hints and imports

### 2. Enhanced Base Scraper Class
**File:** `scrapers/discount_scraper.py`

- Modified `DiscountScraper` base class to accept `DiscountUrl` objects in constructor
- Added `_urls_by_category` internal mapping for efficient URL lookup
- Added `get_urls_for_category()` method to retrieve URLs for a specific category
- Added `extract_discounts_by_category()` method that uses configured URLs internally
- Improved error handling with proper logging

### 3. Updated Individual Scrapers
**Files:** `scrapers/bergfreunde.py`, `scrapers/mountex.py`, `scrapers/fourcamping.py`

- All scrapers now properly inherit from the updated base class
- Added `__init__` methods that call `super().__init__(discount_urls)`
- Maintained all existing functionality while supporting the new architecture

### 4. Refactored Service Layer
**File:** `scrapers/service.py`

- Replaced static `SCRAPER_MAP` with dynamic initialization
- Added `create_discount_urls()` function to build `DiscountUrl` objects from config
- Added `initialize_scrapers()` function to configure scrapers with their URLs
- Added `fetch_discounts_for_category()` function for category-based fetching
- Refactored `fetch_all_discounts()` to use the new architecture
- Improved error handling and logging throughout
- Added proper type hints for better code maintainability

## Benefits of the Refactoring

### 1. **Better Separation of Concerns**
- URL configuration is now separate from discount extraction logic
- Each scraper knows its own URLs and can manage them internally

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Adding new sites or categories is now easier
- URL management is centralized and type-safe
- Better error handling with specific logging

### 3. **Enhanced Type Safety**
- Added proper type hints throughout the codebase
- `DiscountUrl` class provides compile-time safety
- Better IDE support and code completion

### 4. **More Flexible Architecture**
- Scrapers can now be invoked by category name
- Multiple URLs per category are properly supported
- Easier to test individual components

### 5. **Better Error Handling**
- Individual URL failures don't affect other URLs
- Proper logging of errors with context
- Graceful degradation when scrapers fail

## Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_refactoring.py`) was created to verify:
- `DiscountUrl` object creation and validation
- Scraper initialization with URL configuration
- Category-based discount fetching
- All discounts fetching functionality
- Proper category assignment to discounts

All tests pass successfully, confirming the refactoring works correctly.

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility:
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- Web interface functionality is unchanged
- Existing configuration files work without modification
- All existing scrapers continue to function as before

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Better parallelization of category-based fetching
- **Neutral**: No significant performance impact on individual scrapers
- **Positive**: Improved error isolation (one failed URL doesn't affect others)

## Files Modified

1. `scrapers/discount_dto.py` - Added `DiscountUrl` class and updated `Discount`
2. `scrapers/discount_scraper.py` - Enhanced base scraper class
3. `scrapers/service.py` - Complete refactoring of service layer
4. `scrapers/bergfreunde.py` - Updated constructor
5. `scrapers/mountex.py` - Updated constructor
6. `scrapers/fourcamping.py` - Updated constructor
7. `test_refactoring.py` - New comprehensive test suite

## Future Enhancements

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future improvements:
- Easy addition of new scrapers
- Dynamic URL configuration
- Better monitoring and metrics
- Enhanced caching strategies
- More sophisticated error recovery

The refactoring successfully addresses all requirements from GitHub Issue #2 and provides a more robust, maintainable, and extensible architecture for the climbing gear discount aggregator.
